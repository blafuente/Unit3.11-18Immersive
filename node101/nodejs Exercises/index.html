        <p>
            Node..js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment
            that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. JavaScript is used primarily
            for cline-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a 
            webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. 
            Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side 
            scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is 
            sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents 
            a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web application development around a single 
            programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

            Though .js is the conventional filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" 
            does not refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. 
            Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to 
            optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well 
            as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[7]

            The Node.js distributed development project, governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] is facilitated 
            by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]
